# Ruby OS

## Info
Ruby OS will be an system based in Arch Linux with GNOME 42.<p>
Aim to create a system that is easy to use so that anyone can use it as a main system.
At this moment we are planning the development of the project's own applications (they will be open source) written in C++ and C, in addition, we are developing GNOME extensions,that will be very important for us to develop the usability we want.
